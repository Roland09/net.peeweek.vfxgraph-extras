# Visual Effect Graph - Extras

Raw bunch of feature prototypes for use with Visual Effect Graph. These features are mostly unpolished, non-official and unsupported by Unity. Use at your own risk.

## Requirements

* Unity 2020.3 / VFX Graph

## How To Install

You can use a manual, local package installation if you need to alter the code locally or automate the fetch of the repository by using a git address directly. The latter option shall download and manage automatically the repository, with the drawback of being read-only.

### OpenUPM Scoped Registry (2020.1 and newer)

Open Project Preferences and go to Package manager Window.

If not present, add this scoped registry:

* Name: **OpenUPM**
* URL : `https://package.openupm.com`
* Scopes : `net.peeweek`

Once added, you can close the project settings window.

Open Package manager (Window/Package Manager), select the **Visual Effect Graph (Extras)** package, and click the install button.

### Local Package

* Clone repository somewhere of your liking
* Make sure your project is correctly configured with both HDRP and VFX Graph at correct revisions 
* In your project, open the `Window/Package Manager` window and use the + button to select the `Add Package from Disk...` option.
* Navigate to your repository folder and select the `package.json` file
* The repository shall be added

### Git reference version

* Make sure your project is correctly configured with both HDRP and VFX Graph at correct revisions 
* With unity closed, edit the `Packages/manifest.json` with a text editor
* append the line `    "net.peeweek.vfxgraph-extras": "https://github.com/peeweek/net.peeweek.vfxgraph-extras.git",` under `dependencies`
